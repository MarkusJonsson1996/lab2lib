Reflection on Assignment 2

During this assignment i've learn't mostly about how pointers work and how they can be used. Coming from a background of C programming
i've concept wasn't unfamiliar, but i hadn't quite understood how it worked. It is much clearer to me now. A new concept was dynamic memory allocation
which i haven't tried before but was very handy when i got the hang of it.

The assignment was quite difficult and i was stuck on some task for quite some time, mainly task 3, but also learnt the most during this task. Task 8
was a bit frustrating aswell, mainly the first part of the 2:nd step took some time and "googleing" to figure out how to get the link to the library to work.
It was also not quite clear that the 2:nd project needed to be created in the same solution, so a clarification to that part of the 2:nd Step could be
a impovment in my opinion.

I spent about 20 hours on this assignment.
